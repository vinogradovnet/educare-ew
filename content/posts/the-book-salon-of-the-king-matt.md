What links these events - the 140th anniversary of Janusz Korczak and the completion of the "Cultural Bridge" contest?

Janusz Korczak, a Jew by birth, lived and worked in pre-war Poland, led two Orphanages - Polish and Jewish, wrote his books and articles in several languages - and thus proved to be a bridge between two cultures, two peoples.

He believed that children - the same people as adults, only with a slightly smaller experience of life, and they have the same rights, and can participate equally with adults in solving vital life issues.

He not only dreamed about a more just organization of the world, but he organized just so the life of his orphanages. And he wrote about it in his wonderful books, and in particular in the famous book about "King Matt the First".

The contest "Cultural Bridge" invited the children to try themselves in the role of such responsible intermediaries between the two worlds - Russian-speaking and English-speaking cultures - and gain experience in translating professional artistic texts. And thus, to feel the advantages and the responsibility that fate (and parents :-)) has given them - together with the opportunity to freely speak, read, write, and think in two languages.

During the contest, children speaking two languages (Russian and English) and living in the USA translated stories of Russian-speaking writers from Russian into English. For many of them it was the first experience of literary translation. Works of young participants were read and analyzed by jury members - professional writers and translators.

On the meeting held on April 21, 2018 in the "School-Plus in Manhattan" (New York) more than 40 young translators and their favorite adults took part (https://www.facebook.com/events/441474676307328/)

We got acquainted with the books of Janusz Korczak and together with their heroes allowed themselves to dream a little. We hope that children and adults will take a great interest in the ideas and heroes of the great dreamer and will read his books about King Matt, Kaytek the Wizard, a small Jack-businessman.

Under the guidance of Olga Bukhina, a professional translator, one of the jury members of the "Cultural Bridge" contest, we trained our translational skills, working with texts in Russian and English.

We congratulated the winners of the "Cultural Bridge: Russian-English" Contest in the USA (those who were able to attend the Salon on that day) and handed them diplomas and wonderful books sent to us by the partner publishers of the Contest.

All participants of the Book Salon received bookmarks as a gift with a reminder of the books of Janusz Korczak, which are worth reading to all the young (and not necessarily young) dreamers.

Thanks to everyone who was with us today!
