title: Why Korczak?
description: Janusz Korczak, the pen name of Henryk Goldszmit (July 22, 1878/79 – August 5, 1942), was a Polish-Jewish educator, children's author, and pediatrician known as Stary Doktor ("Old Doctor"). After spending years working as the co-director of a Jewish orphanage in Warsaw, he had refused sanctuary and stayed with his orphans when the entire population of the institution was sent from the Ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp, during the Warsaw’s Grossaktion in August 1942.

We need to combine efforts, resources, ideas, people for doing something really valuable in our world.
To combine **we need a common framework, common ground**.
Korczak (his personality, his ideas, his practice) can serve as our common ground for uniting.

Korczak is **«multicultural»** and at the same time he is very specific in formulating his national, cultural roots and bases: 
a Jew by birth, he devoted his whole life to his beloved Poland, 
part of the time he lived in Russia, he is respected throughout the world.

On the one hand, Korczak was **one of the whole "galaxy"**, of the movement of the brilliant teachers of the first half of the 20th century who in fact at one time thought "in unison" and did common things (in different countries, in different circumstances, in different ways) - they helped a child to be a human today.

This gives us grounds (if I correlate myself with Korczak’s ideas) to feel in the context of global trends in education of a child, and to not be alone in my search.

On the other hand, Korczak - a unique teacher, whose experience is very modern, and is now in demand.

Korczak is probably the first who so clearly formulated the idea of children's rights, **rights of a child for respect** - important for all of us.

Korczak not only formulated the idea, but he also brilliantly showed with his own practice how it can be implemented in the work with children; he created the **teaching tools** quite relevant today.
