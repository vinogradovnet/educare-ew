# About the annual conference on alternative education

### 1997 - 2019


## Why are we holding our conference?
 
We regard our conference as a platform for discussing emerging educational prospects, comprehending the experience of various existing alternative practices, and the possibility of implementing various social initiatives. We hope that this conference is a place of friendly and mutually interested meeting of practitioners and researchers.
 
We are convinced that alternative education is the environment where answers to many urgent questions of training and upbringing of the younger generation ripen, where possible promising lines of educational development arise.
Therefore, it is so important to comprehend the available alternatives and we need the support of social initiatives that embody them.
 
In many ways, to support such initiatives, we consider it important to organize our conference as a public space for dialogue on education.
 
It is important for us to present to each other and the community the existing practices and to hear a friendly and meaningful assessment. It is important for us to get not only moral support in our activities, but also partners for collaboration. It is important for us, together with researchers, to relate our experiences and experiments with the existing tradition, to hear new ideas and think about previously unrecognized problems, to see new horizons of development.

And, of course, it is important to understand that you are not alone, that there are still people who are looking in the same direction as you. There are people from whom you can learn, from whom you can find support, with whom you can think about common actions. We hope that there is an opportunity, no matter how difficult it may be, to gradually build a community that can oppose general simplification - the constructive steps of developing complexity, cultivating the human in specific children and adults, and diversity in society as a whole.
