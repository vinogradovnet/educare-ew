### 1. "Home Alone" Training Package

_For students in grades 1-11 who are ready to study at home independently and individually._  

Studying within the framework of the "Home Alone" package is an independent study of the curriculum with the support of experienced teachers and a convenient electronic information and educational system. Students have the opportunity to meet individually with teachers to discuss what they have learned and receive detailed comments on the results of certification.

### 2. "Successful Student" Training Package

_For students in grades 1-11 who would like to study individually in a particular school subject._

The "Successful Student" training package allows children, while remaining students of their school, to improve their knowledge in some subjects of the school curriculum.

### 3. "Learning Together" Training Package

_For those students in grades 3-8 who would like to learn effectively in a peer group without leaving home._

Learning as part of the "Learning Together" package is an active interaction with the teacher and with fellow peers during online classes. We believe that during their studies it is important for children to communicate with their peers, infect each other with interest in the subject, support them in joint creativity and work. Even being in different cities and countries.
