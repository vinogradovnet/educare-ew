Acquaintance with mathematics in this vein implies that for its development it is important to help students and visitors to live the drama of the ideas underlying this science, and not only to remember the laws and facts already born by other people. It is important to experience the surprise of meeting with science and other positive feelings and emotions that show that mathematics is interesting and fascinating.

“Mathematics for all” is, first of all, an understanding of the foundations available to everyone, and only then a deepening in operational skills.

Often this understanding is achieved, including through practical application, showing that mathematics is not only abstract knowledge, but also a language that allows one to describe many phenomena of the surrounding life; science, the development of which helps change the world.
